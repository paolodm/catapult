Includes searching, filtering, email updates, single-sign-on, and more.

## Setting up Catapult

This code can be used by any company but will require some customization to make it work.
* Integration with company's authentication system so employees can sign in but nobody else can.
* Integration with the company's Jobvite system. This includes creating some custom reports that Catapult uses to retrieve data.
* Configuration to match company hiring workflow. Catapult will create a column for each workflow step candidates go through such as Phone Screen and Offer Call.
* Special handling of custom Jobvite fields set up by recruiting.
